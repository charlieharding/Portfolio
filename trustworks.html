						<h3>What made the project challenging was the complexity of the relationships between a user and their trusts, firms and companies.</h3>
					</div>
					<h4>Making trusts easy</h4>
					<div class='text-columns'>
						<p>Trustworks offered many tricky UX moments in creating a frictionless experience. Trust management is a complex thing to start with but what took to diabolical levels is a user's relationships. One user can have a relationship (and according permissions) to personal trusts, companies, firms, the trusts their firm's have relationships with, as well as customer service operators. Showing how these relationships relate and more importantly in what capacity a user is acting in at anytime had to be shown in an intuitive and manageable way. We solved this challenge with a multi-level navigation that always showed in what capacity you were acting with the second level showing what permissions you had in that capacity.</p>

						<h3>Dealing with people's wealth and livelihoods meant it was crucial that we appeared trustworthy.</h3>
					</div>
					<h4>Finding the aesthetic.</h4>
					<div class='text-columns'>
						<p>It seems weird to say about a company called Trustworks but building trust was key to the design. We were designing a product that would be used to manage people's wealth, it not only had to be actually reliable but it had to look like it was reliable. We designed for trust by using a clean aesthetic and dark blues—one of the most trustworthy colours according to colour psychology. We used recognisable design patterns and avoided surprises, everything had to work as expected.</p>
						<p>Consistency was also key in this project. Dis-jointed elements is a deed give-away to an unprofessional system and would harm that trust we were building. To combat this one of our deliverables was a comprehensive pattern library. In that we were able to detail colours, interactions, icons and every other part of the system.</p>
