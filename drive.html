						<h3>Drive is a project about behaviour change. We didn&#8217;t want to just help drivers pass tests but to learn what it means to be a good kiwi driver.</h3>
					</div>
					<h4>Why we did it</h4>
					<div class='text-columns'>
						<p>Drive is a joint project between NZTA and ACC, two New Zealand government agencies. The aim of the project was to modernise the experience of learning to drive while focussing on creating &lsquo;good kiwi drivers&rsquo;. The current New Zealand licence tests focus on knowledge of the road code and technical driving ability, but there&#8217;s more to being a good driver than that. In Drive we needed to bring in content about everything else that makes a good driver such as self-awareness and understanding the social contract of using the road. The challenge was balancing this extra content with users who are looking for the fastest, easiest way to pass their tests.</p>
						<p>The foundation of the Drive project was the two personas of Matt and Dan. Matt and Dan represented the area were we could do the most good; typical young male drivers, around 17&ndash;19 years old. These are the kids that are heavily over-represented in crash statistics. Everything we did on Drive had to pass our litmus test of &lsquo;would Matt and Dan use this?&rsquo;. Getting Matt and Dan to understand the importance of safe driving would lead to huge gains in making New Zealand roads safer.</p>

						<h3>Drive was a project that offered many opportunities for me to delve into areas outside of pure visual design.</h3>
					</div>
					<h4>What exactly would you say you do here?</h4>
					<div class='text-columns'>
						<p>I joined the Drive project as a visual designer near the start of the first phase. Working with two other designers we built a base of visual research, helped establish the Drive brand and designed the Drive website. Drive is a beast of a website ande expected web-design work the portion we call the interactive road code was an all together new challenge for us. It involved coming up with over a dozen gamified interactions to teach users very specific aspects of the road code and then tying them together within modules. The interactions were a great opportunity to delve into the game-design I love and work on something a bit different.</p>
						<p>Drive also gave me a chance to stretch my wings in the user experience side of design. I was able to be a part of the concept phase where we assessed how we'd meet the learning objectives NZTA and ACC had identified. I was also a part of the user testing and co-design sessions and worked with the UXers to create wireframes.</p>
						<p>By phase two I was working as the sole visual designer as well as stepping into the main UX role on the project. This gave me a lot of control over the direction of the work and let me take it from concept all the way through to development and testing. The main piece of work for phase two was recreating the user's dashboard. I got to work on not only the visual structure and look of all the components but also created the logic that made the dashboard personal to the user's journey through the licensing process.</p>

					<h4>How we made it.</h4>
					<div class='text-columns'>
						<p>So what was the magic stuff that got us through this project? One important element was that everyone was invested in Drive&#8217;s success. We had a client that was eager to be involved in the process and were able to use their subject matter expertise to challenge our solutions. The full Heyday production team was also involved throughout the process so everyone understood how we reached our solutions. This personal investment meant that those ideas and solutions were rigorously interrogated, no-one was willing to let average work slide.</p>
						<p>How we worked also played a role. Drive was the first Agile project I&#8217;d worked on. Its structure helped ensure by the end of the first phase we had something viable to stand up. Even if that meant it was just a serviceable stool instead of a half-finished throne. We also reviewed the process fortnightly to identify what was a challenge and how we could remedy it.</p>
